# Raspberry Filter & Toggle All Feature

## Overview

Added filtering capabilities to show only events with "raspberry" rewards and bulk toggle functionality for all filtered events.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Raspberry Filter

- **All Events**: Shows all events regardless of raspberry status (default)
- **Raspberry Only**: Shows only events that have `raspberry: true` property
- Filter works in combination with existing filters (view mode, focus filter)

### 2. Toggle All Filtered Events

- **Enable All Filtered**: Enables all events currently visible in the filtered view
- **Disable All Filtered**: Disables all events currently visible in the filtered view
- Only appears when there are filtered events to operate on

## UI Components

### Filter Controls

Located in the Desktop View Controls panel:

- **Raspberry Filter section** with raspberry icon üçá
- Two buttons: "All Events" and "Raspberry Only"
- Pink highlight for active raspberry filter

### Bulk Actions

Located below other filters when filtered events exist:

- **Enable All Filtered** button (green styling)
- **Disable All Filtered** button (red styling)
- Tooltips explain what each action does

## Technical Implementation

### Type Definitions

```typescript
export type RaspberryFilter = "all" | "raspberry-only";

export interface EventFilters {
  selectedDay?: number;
  viewMode: ViewMode;
  focusFilter: FocusFilter;
  raspberryFilter: RaspberryFilter;
  visibleDays?: boolean[];
}
```

### Filtering Logic

In `useEventData.ts`:

```typescript
// Apply raspberry filter
if (raspberryFilter === "raspberry-only") {
  filtered = filtered.filter((event) => event.raspberry === true);
}
```

### Toggle All Implementation

```typescript
const toggleAllFiltered = useCallback(
  async (enabled: boolean) => {
    // Get all unique events from the filtered view
    const filteredEventIds = new Set<string>();
    Object.values(filteredEvents).forEach((timeEvents) => {
      timeEvents.forEach((event) => {
        filteredEventIds.add(event.id);
      });
    });

    // Toggle each filtered event
    const togglePromises = Array.from(filteredEventIds).map((eventId) =>
      toggleEvent(eventId, enabled, undefined)
    );

    await Promise.all(togglePromises);
  },
  [filteredEvents, toggleEvent]
);
```

‚úÖ **Bulk operations** - Enable/disable multiple events at once  
‚úÖ **Smart integration** - Works with all existing filters  
‚úÖ **Visual feedback** - Clear icons and color coding  
‚úÖ **Efficient** - Memoized filtering and optimized re-renders
