ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ ENTERING CREATIVE PHASE: ARCHITECTURE DESIGN ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨ðŸŽ¨

## ARCHITECTURE CHALLENGE
Design a robust PWA architecture that handles offline storage, service worker notifications, and real-time reminder scheduling while maintaining mobile performance.

## ARCHITECTURE OPTIONS

### Option 1: Client-Side Only Architecture
- LocalStorage + IndexedDB for data persistence
- Service Worker handles all notifications
- No backend dependencies
- Pros: Simple, fast, offline-first
- Cons: Limited cross-device sync

### Option 2: Hybrid with Optional Cloud Sync
- Primary: Local storage for immediate performance
- Secondary: Optional cloud sync for backup
- Service Worker manages both local and sync notifications
- Pros: Best of both worlds, progressive enhancement
- Cons: More complex, requires backend for sync feature

## ARCHITECTURE DECISION
**Selected: Client-Side Only Architecture (Option 1)**

### Component Structure:
1. **Data Layer**: IndexedDB with Dexie.js wrapper
2. **Service Layer**: Notification scheduler + permission manager
3. **UI Layer**: React components with TanStack Router
4. **PWA Layer**: Service Worker + Manifest + Workbox
